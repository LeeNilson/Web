    <p> The factorial of a natural number n, represented by n!, is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n.
        This operation, which does not apply to negative or decimal numbers, is essential in combinatorial analysis for
        solving counting and element organization problems. By convention, the factorial of zero, 0!, is defined as 1.
        Definition and Calculation
        The factorial of a number n (where n is a natural number) is the product of n by all its positive integer
        predecessors, up to 1.
        Example: 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.
        Notation
        The factorial is indicated by the number followed by the exclamation mark (!), as in n!.
        Special Cases
        Factorial of zero (0!): By definition, 0! = 1.
        Factorial of one: 1! = 1.
        Applications
        Combinatorial Analysis: Factorials are essential for calculating arrangements, combinations, and permutations,
        which are ways of organizing and counting elements in a set.
        Computer Science: Used in algorithm analysis to understand the complexity and efficiency of processes.
        Probability and Statistics: Helps determine the number of ways to arrange items or the occurrence of events.

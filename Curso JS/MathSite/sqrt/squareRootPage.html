    <p> The square root of a number is another number that, when multiplied by itself, results in the original number,
        being the inverse operation of squaring. The symbol for the square root is the radical (√), and the number
        inside it is the radicand. For example, the square root of 9 is 3 (√9 = 3), because 3 multiplied by 3 equals 9.
        Example:
        √16 = 4: because 4 x 4 = 16
        √25 = 5: because 5 x 5 = 25
        Terminology:
        Radical: The symbol (√) that represents the square root operation.
        Radicand: The number inside the radical, which is the number whose root we want to find.
        Root (or Square Root): The result of the operation, that is, the number that, multiplied by itself, gives the
        radicand.
        Characteristics:
        Inverse Operation: The square root is the inverse operation of raising to a power of 2.
        Square Root of a Perfect Square: Numbers such as 9, 16, and 25 are called perfect squares because their square
        roots (3, 4, and 5, respectively) are whole numbers.
        Index: In root calculation, the index is the number that indicates the order of the root. For the square root,
        the index is 2 and, by convention, is usually not written.
